In this project let's build a **Covid19 Dashboard** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a **class component**, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You will also be given feedback by code reviewers after your project submission.
